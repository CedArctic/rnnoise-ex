(1) Compile Valin's feature extraction application as modified by us: 
    cd src ; ./compile.sh

(2) Run the feature extraction application that also dumps the raw noisy samples in ./src/extractedSamples
    ./denoise_training signal.raw noise.raw count > training.f32

    (note the matrix size and replace 500000 87 below)

(2) Convert the raw samples dumped above to wave files and clip them at the exact appropriate length to avoid problems.
    48000 khz sampling rate and a 480 samples frame window 

(3) cd training ; ./bin2hdf5.py ../src/training.f32 500000 87 training.h5

(4) ./rnn_train.py

(5) ./dump_rnn.py weights.hdf5 ../src/rnn_data.c ../src/rnn_data.h
